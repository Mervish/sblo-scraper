# sblo-scraper
An incomplete scraper program for the Japanese Sakura (sblo.jp) blogging platform.

Designed to capture text and images while maintaining their order. Has ability to "walk" through the blog's pages. Currently can parse pages, but I have not yet decided on the save format.

# Build
Uses C++ 20. Requires boost, gumbo, cpr and icu.
